2016 Six Nations Rugby Championship Shiny Predictive Application
========================================================

Problem definition
========================================================
<small>
I am a fan of Rugby and enjoy applying analytics to various sports.  

The [2016 six nations rugby championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Six_Nations_Championship) has recently started and I wanted to create a predictive application to give some basic insights on match results based on the 2015 championship results.

__The problem to solve:__  
Can we predict the match outcomes of the 2016 Championship using a combination of the results of the   past 2015 championship and the on-going 2016 championship?
</small>


Training Data and Predictive Model
========================================================
class: small-code
<small>
For my shiny application, I made the 'naive' assumption that the Rugby scores were Poisson distributed and applied a simple Generalized Linear Model with Poisson-log link function similarly to the one used by  Martin Eastwood(see [Predicting Football Using R](http://pena.lt/y/2014/11/02/predicting-football-using-r/)).
</small>



<small>The training dataset contains the following column variables:</small>

```r
head(training,3)
```

```
     Team Opponent Score Home Result
1   Wales    Italy    23    1      W
2  France  England    26    1      W
3 Ireland Scotland    28    1      W
```

<small>And the prediction model is trained as follows:</small>

```r
model <- glm(Score ~ Home + Team + Opponent, data=training, family=poisson(link="log"))
```


Example of a Fixture Prediction: 
========================================================
class: small-code
<small>The code below illustrates how a fixture prediction is performed using the fitted glm model (e.g. 'England - Ireland' ):</small>

```r
## Home scoring rate prediction
lambda <<- predict(model, data.frame(Home=1, Team="England", Opponent="Ireland"), type="response")

## Away Team scoring rate prediction
mu <<- predict(model, data.frame(Home=0, Team="Ireland", Opponent="England"), type="response")

## Joint-Distriubtion table of scores estimation
maxScore <- 65
prob_matrix <<- dpois(0:maxScore, lambda) %*% t(dpois(0:maxScore, mu))

## Probability summarisation
WinPr <- sum(prob_matrix[lower.tri(prob_matrix)])
DrawPr <- sum(diag(prob_matrix))
LosePr <- sum(prob_matrix[upper.tri(prob_matrix)])

cat(sprintf("Lamdba=%.2f, Mu=%.2f\nEngland to Win=%.2f, to Draw=%.2f, to Lose=%.2f against Ireland",lambda,mu,WinPr,DrawPr,LosePr))
```

```
Lamdba=17.43, Mu=13.52
England to Win=0.73, to Draw=0.06, to Lose=0.21 against Ireland
```



Results and Conclusions
========================================================
<small>
We are now two weeks in the 2016 championship, out of 6 played matches the Shiny Application correctly predicted 4 match outcomes but with what seems to be large probability values. We can conclude that the observed estimated probabilities and decimal odd values seem too extreme and should not be trusted (.i.e for value betting). But the application is good enough to provide some intuitive insights into the future match outcomes and relative strength of the Rugby teams (refer to the Offensive/Defensive strength chart).</small>

<small>To try next:</small>
- <small>Break down the score variable into tries and penalty covariates (likely to be more like Poisson random variables : E(X) ~ Var(X)).</small>
- <small>To use more data and cross-validation to minimize overfitting.</small>
- <small>Try alternative model algorithms (e.g. hierarchical MCMC Bayesian Regression models to use priors).</small>
